        <p>We are a duo team from HCI and we want to create a website for schools to sell merchandise.
        This way, school merch teams will be able to sell merchandise all year round. It can also be 
        a platform for merchandise advertising and transaction. There will also be a smoother user 
        experience and convenient for merch team to put up and sell merchandise. We hope that this 
        website would be able to help schools and students.
