    <h1>Our goal?</h1>
    <p> We want to create a website specifically for schools to sell merchandise. We feel 
        that with a website, school merch teams can sell their merchandise year round like 
        hoodies, pencil cases and files. Our website will hopefully be a platform for 
        merchandise advertising and smoother user payment experience. This will be convenient 
        for students to buy and sell merchandise.</p>
